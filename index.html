<p><b>About Origami</p></b>
<p><b><i>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese 
   culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all
  folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. Traditional Japanese 
  origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603–1867).The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished
  sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners 
  generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami 
  folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.Almost any 
  laminar (flat) material can be used for folding; the only requirement is that it
  should hold a crease.
